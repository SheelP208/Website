   <h2>Has a salad bar where the customer can choose what ingrediants and how much they want of it. Once done ordering, the customer pays and a thank you sign pops up. I used a variety of if statements for user input and functions/turtles to draw the ingrediants. I also used for loops for the amount of ingrediants dispensed.  </h2>

After succefully catching the rocket, exit out the maze to get score. If the user is caught by the follower or hits any walls, it is game over and a message appears on the screen. The score shows up at the end of the game.</h2>
