The point of the game is to get as many of the rockets as you can without hitting any walls or getting caught by the follower(UFO). After succefully catching the rocket, exit out the maze to get score. If the user is caught by the follower or hits any walls, it is game over and a message appears on the screen. The score shows up at the end of the game.</h2>

     <h3>We thought the alien planet was marsh lands because the data shows smooth/constant temperatuers that vary throughout the day and the light is also low and ambient. The data also shows the sound being a constant chipping/buzzing. All of our data matches up with the criteria for the marsh lands alien planet.</h3>
